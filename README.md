# Currying-in-JS
Brief explantation and implementation of currying in Javascript 

 Currying is a way of constructing functions that allows partial application of a function’s arguments. What this means is that you can pass all of the arguments a function is expecting and get the result, or pass a subset of those arguments and get a function back that’s waiting for the rest of the arguments.

**Why currying?**
- It is a powerful approach to create a lot of very detailed custom functions.
 
A very **common JS interview question** is output of add(2)(3)(5) ?
